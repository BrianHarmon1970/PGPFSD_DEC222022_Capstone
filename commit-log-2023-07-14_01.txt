07/14/2023 4:00PM BankServiceProcess(es) -> ResourceManager managed resources

	
	1. Enabled JPA Transaction Management to allow for long process commits - rollback happens on exception automatically

	2. put Transaction control on the BankServiceProcess processTransaction driving function

	3. created ManagedResources to contain the three process of BankServiceProcess - AccountCreate, AccountDeposit, AccountWithdraw
		provided methods to access these from the _static resources and modified order/API processes to use these new accessors 
		to provide the call for the managed process resources. processes now implemented as managed resources. 

	4. modified the Validate and preValidate methods of withdraw and deposit to do the validation checks later as this is no longer necessary
	   so early in the process. The previous concern was that data might be modified ( proabbly not in hindsight ) but now not concerned
	   as there should be a rollback initiated by JPA if there is an exception thrown and so no data will be modified in that case.

	5. modified the interface and all subclass instances to notify the JVM that exceptions will be thrown. these are all caught in the 
	   driver method ( if any are actually thrown ).

	6. added meta-data descriptors for the configuration items of the API roots that were left out initially. works fine without them but
	   found warning about them not being there and so added them.
