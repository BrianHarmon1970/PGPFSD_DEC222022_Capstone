7/16/2023 12:16PM AccountTransactionContext for resource allocation by process


	1. Split BankResourceManager.java to create ResourceManager.java
		General base class objects moved to new file ResourceManager.java
		ResourceManager
		ManagedResource
		ResourceLock
		ConcurrencyLock
		ProcessResource
		JPA Repository and Entity Templates
		BankResourceManager now only contains application specific object classes

	2. created a specific context class, AccountTransactionContext to contain and maintain
	   resources related to process acting on one account and one transaction. moved all of the
	   relevant dependencies of BankServiceResources to this new containing class.

	3. added a default instance of the AccountTransactionContext within BankServiceResources
	   and redirected most of the external dependencies to use this new context replacing 
	   the majority of the coded features of BankServiceResources. An additional context
	   for AccountCreateProcess will replace most or all of the rest.
