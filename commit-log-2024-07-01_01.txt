07/01/2024 11:11PM Webfront frame fixes and Angular/JavaScript fun stuff.

	1. moved main application components into the main modula and main routing, 
		enabled AuthGuards so that they no longer break out to opening frame
	
	2. removed the need for local storage between page updates by getting the injected 
		Model service persitent across cmpoenent switches. 

	3. removed the need for a route change on component switches using the Data Model / per
		View. Much better performance... but still need to make sure that an account 
		gets loaded even if it defaults to the first of the list.. or does not try to
		display a null account. (details.. and details.. and testing yet to do.) 
	
	3. -- added stub component ( less implementation ) for order-detail -- still needs implementation
		for order detail and product selection and submission as well as order approval and/or
		cancellation/rejection.
