7/12/2023 11:14PM - Initial refactors and revisions towards implementing Resource Management of BankService data and data process


	1. Made BankResource Jpa repositories and entity(s) private and provided getter methods insulating and decoupling process methods from
	   resource data.
	2. refactored and included Account, Transaction and capacity repositories in ResourceManager.
	3. refactored and included Account, Transaction and capaicity records as ManagedResources and added as BankResourceManager managed resources.
	4. removed all dependencies of BankResources - acctRecord, txRecord, acctCapacity, classTypeCapacity, and effectiveCapacity individual
		records and re-implemented as managed_txRecord, managed_accountRecord, managed_effectiveCaps, managed resources. these will go away
		as well in the future, but to be re-used as convenient accessors to the managed resources of BankResourceManager, and likely encapsulated
		into a containing classe relevant to the instance of the processed tranasaction.
	5. verified and removed all dependencies on the Repository references of TxLogRecordRepository, AccountRecordRepository, and AccountCapacityRecordRepository.
		these are now directly initialized into managed resources of the resource manager.
