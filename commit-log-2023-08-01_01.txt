08/01/2023 12:28PM Completion of BankService UserOrder product services

	1. Corrections to previous commited code
		Refactored fixing a typographical error in the DualTransactionContext for AccountTransfer
		the accessor method of the serviceContext for getSecondaryAccount was entered as getSeoncaryAccount
		
		Product repository had been overlooked for inclusion in BankServiceResources. 
		Added ProductRepository implementation to BankServiceResources and provided appropriate accessors
		and initialization.

		had overlooked resource initialization of spring declared repository instances from BankServiceController for 
		new repositories: UserOrderRepository, ProductRepository, OrderItemRepository. Now propagated fully down to 
		BankService and associated components.

		experimented with re-implementing Searchable data set on Product REST API using JpaRepository findBy( Example ).
		found that this seems to work and with much simpler implementation compared to the TypedQuery that was used 
		previously but will not be effective for selecting date ranges if findBy( Example ) requires an exact match, 
		which seems to be the case. Mixed results and feeelings about this but have now tried it out and feeling better 
		for that. none of this is used in the context of the current application however.
		Also found that the repositories must be derived interface instances of JpaRepository rather than CrudRepository
		as they were previously in order to use findBy( Example ). The regular methods for CrudeRepository are still available
		this way but I wonder what are the subtle caveats and differences between these two implementations.

	2. Completed process implementation for OrderSubmitService and OrderUpdateService
		OrderSubmitService now creates the appropriate records for a new order and assigns identity as supplied by client request.
		OrderUpdateService now initializes appropriate records and updates the OrderStatus as indicated by client request

		had to add accessors for OrderItem ID value to fully implement these services. this value is a convenience for using the JPA
		architecture but the more pure identity of an OrderItem record is better expressed by the concatenation of OrderId and ProducId.
		compromises were made and i had to be reminded to include accessors for this JPA convenient value.
