07/26/2023 6:13PM Refactoring of ServiceContext and AccountProcess into BankService - reworked Order to Process routing.


	1. moved context objects from _static into BankService ( _static.bankService )
		AccountCreateContext and AccountTransactionContext now instanced inside BankService class.
		Contexts now instanced and initialized in BankService ( were instanced as _static and initialized 
		in BankServiceResources.
	
	2. moved resource managed processes into BankService
		these were instanced on per call basis from a created order from the BankService REST API as submitted 
		to bankService ( BankService instance ). now created and initialized at the time of the BankService 
		initialization on call to setResourceProviders from the API Controller. processes are now initialized 
		here with appropriate reference to correlated process context objects.

	3. added a routing map associating order objects to process objects, existing with BankService.
		BankService now looks up the appropriate process according to the order type received from the REST API
		controller and initiates the process call accordingly.
	
	4. implemented fulfill() method on the BankServiceProcess base class and implemented a new abstract for initProcess 
	   methed on the IBankServiceProcess interface.
		removed all implementations of fulfill and added a generic implementation to the base class that makes a call
		to the derived initProcess befor calling processTransaction() method. This is also implemented generically and 
		with TransactionManagement enabled and so very important to be sure that this is called rather than a derived 
		non transactional method. sub-classes now implement specific initial setup on the newly called initProcess()
		method and do not have to explicit call processTransaction() nor do they have to implement it. all that is 
		required is to fulfill the remaining abstracts of the IBankServiceProcess interface.

	5. updated all process methods to reference the in class reference to the specific process context objects rather than 
		the previously defined _static ones.
