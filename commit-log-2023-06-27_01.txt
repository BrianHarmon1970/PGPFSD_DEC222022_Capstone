 06/27/2023 12:57PM  - WebFront and Service implemntation of configured Account class/type

	
	WebFront changes - 
	Modified Angular bank-service service to include the accountClasstype model record and getAll function.
	Modified Angular form to use the service to get those records and include them in a select box for the user.
	Modified the service request order to now include the tagName gathered by the configuration data and sent to
	BankService.

	*Also reinstated code that loaded the user record so that the user name and userid string can be presented as 
	a heading on the form. ( account create only needs the userid record key ).

	
	BankService changes -
	account-create order now required to set the new field of AccountRecord to the id derived by lookup of the tagName supplied in
	the request order. This id is derived by lookup into the configuration data for the defined account types.
	The Entity definition was also expanded to include the new field value. As a consequence the queries relating Masters and Sub accounts
	had to be expanded to include the new field value in order to be complete in the representation of the data form for the Jpa ( now expecting 
	to see a record in that form ).

	SQL data changes... none really expected for this commit but did attempt to rebuild the dataset with the much modified ( previous commits )
	script. There were some fails and so the appropriate changes were worked out and added which allows the tables to be destructed and 
	reconstructed in proper order such that integrety constraints are respected. (this should have been done before committing the previous update).
