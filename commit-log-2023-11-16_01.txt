	2. Added initial basic components for Product and Order

	3. Created context Model and initial experimentation within account-transactions component to 
	   use this model to display conditional context sensitive components and data depending on what the 
	   user page requires. had to add context specific persistence at the application level to allow
	   for page switching without loss of component context model parameters. this design is initial 
	   and not complete but has been a while since update and commiting initial implementation as is.
