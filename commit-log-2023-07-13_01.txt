07/13/2023 6:34PM  ResourceManager Repository additions (amended 7/14/2023 6:46)

 	1. Refactored the remaining Jpa Repositories into MangedResource components of ResourceManager 
 	   - UserRepository
	   - AccountClassTypeRecordRepository
	   - AccountMasterSubLinkRepository

	2. Re-wrote managed_ records to be fully initialized in the resource manager and then re used these
	   resource objects as assigned references to the ResourceManager contained RecordResources.
		managed_TxRecord 
		managed_CapsRecord
		managed_acctRecord

	7/14/2023 - Apparently tested without rebuild - changes required 
	1. construction of RepositoryResources for AccountMasterSublinkRecordRepository and AccountClastTypeRecordRepository
	   prevented the java class resolution from resolving correctly. fixed.
	2. A typo on the user repository resulted in a clash with Capacity repository resource being assigned to the User
	 	repository instead. FIXED.. now the eorrect resource is associated for UserRepository
	3. new account initialization needed to be updated to initialize the managed resource record for new account
