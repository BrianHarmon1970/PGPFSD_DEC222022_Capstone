07/01/2023 07:23PM - WebFront and Service account create implemntation - update, Webform account-create complete with master and sub account special case.

	1. defined scope for sprint-III create account with configured primary and secondary savings and checking account types

	2. added ability to determine the capacity attributes of a selected account type on the account-create component form
	   and the ability to acquire a list of user master accounts suitable for selection for sub account linkage. BankService
	   and WebFront APIs and services were updated to achieve this.

	3. added a conditional select list field on the form for account-create, allowing user to indicate a selection for association 
	   to a requested sub-account type. collected the accountId selected and supplied this in the order request, with bank-service-order
	   updated to include this field ( for MasterAccountId ).

	4. BankService processing (AccountCreateServiceOrder) for account-create receives the MasterAccountId and makes the link in the join table 
	   associating master and sub account. added this aspect to the creation. 

	5. modified BankService AccountCreateServiceOrder -> to also include an entry into the accoount_master_sub table when a master enabled 
	   account is selected and submitted. failing to do this results in the account not reflecting those capacities, i.e. not selectable as master and 
	   not linkable to sub account. 

 	6. added REST API access to MasterSubAccount data service
	 	/api/account/master (GET) ->  List<AccountRecord> findAllMaster( )
         	/api/account/masters-for-user/{id} (GET) -> List<AccountRecord> findAllMastersByUserId( id )( id )
    	 	/api/account/subs-by-master/{id} (GET) ->  List<AccountRecord> findAllSubsByMasterId( id )
    	 	/api/account/master-by-sub/{id} (GET) -> AccountRecord getMasterBySubId( id )

    	7. added query for findAllMasterByUserId to the MasterSubAccount data service (JPA Repository)
