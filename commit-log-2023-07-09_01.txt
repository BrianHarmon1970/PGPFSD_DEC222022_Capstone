07/09/2023	Rfactor of BankServiceOrder to BankServiceOrder and BankServiceProcess; Revision of BankResources and Resource intialization.

		
		1. created _static:
			a module scoped ( accessible to any within module object )
			container ( class object ) of whatever you want for no purpose 
			except to be easy to access within module.

		2. refactored, splitting BankServiceOrder into two independent parts as Order and Process.
			expanded AccountCreateOrder with full implementation of the new split.

		3. clean up - removed a lot of commented code.. from previous releases.
